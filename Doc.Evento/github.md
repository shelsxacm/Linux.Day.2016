Hello there, I am Shelsy a 19 years old programming-student from Panama City, Panama. I met the Octocat movement thanks to a teacher, after that I fell in love with everything at GitHub.
I am also part of a movement called Floss Panamá (@floss-pa on GitHub) an open-source group of students from Universidad Interamericana de Panama, we are planning an event celebrating the 25th Birthday of Linux “The Linux Day”, just because we are trying to make bigger and bigger the open source community in our country, we all in this group are users of GitHub and we want your support to make this community grow, we all know is a huge process but we are really committed and inspired by you guys. 
For the day of the event, we want you to give us your support in a way you’re comfortable with, it could be a video-message, a videoconference. We just want to inspire the attendants at the event, to enjoy “the best way to build software together.”  
If you have any suggestions or are interested in supporting our community from Panamá: shelsy.chanis@uip.edu.pa or misscadxverous@gmail.com 

And we are also having a Pre Linux day event, consist in some workshops and one of them is completely based on Git and GitHub. You can check out the flyers :)
